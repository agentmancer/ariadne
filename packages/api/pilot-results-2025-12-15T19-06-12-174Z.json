Maya felt it before she saw it—that prickling sensation at the back of her neck that had saved her life more than once. The centerpiece of the Eastern Wing, a Tang dynasty jade horse valued at twelve million dollars, sat undisturbed in its case. But the laser grid that should have crisscrossed the floor was dark, and a single security camera hung limp from its mount, wires severed clean. Tom's radio crackled with static behind her.\\n\\n\\\"Detective,\\\" he whispered, his face pale in the emergency lighting. \\\"I did my rounds twenty minutes ago.
